;;;; The purpose of the functions and the macro in this file is to
;;;; help handle source-tracking information.  The main entry point in
;;;; this file is the macro DB which is very similar to the standard
;;;; Common Lisp macro DESTRUCTURING-BIND, except that DB is less
;;;; general than DESTRUCTURING-BIND in that it does not handle an
;;;; arbitrary lambda list; only a trees of variables, similar to the
;;;; destructuring done by LOOP.  Also, DB does not destructure an
;;;; ordinary Common Lisp tree, and instead works on a concrete syntax
;;;; tree.  Finally, DB takes an additional argument (the first one)
;;;; compared to DESTRUCTURING-BIND.  That argument is a variable that
;;;; will be bound to the SOURCE slot of the CST.

;;; This function generates code for destructuring a concrete syntax
;;; tree according to a tree of variables.  TREE is a tree of variable
;;; names (symbols).  FORM is a form that, at runtime, computes the
;;; concrete syntax tree to be assigned to the root of TREE.  This
;;; function returns a list of bindings to be used in a LET* form.
;;; These bindings destructure the root value until the leaves of the
;;; tree are reached, generating intermediate temporary variables as
;;; necessary.  The destructuring code calls the functions CST:FIRST
;;; and CST:REST so that an error is signaled whenever the
;;; corresponding place in the value tree is not a CONS-CST
